Sydney Mead was a visionary artist who created stunning and imaginative designs for various modes of transportation, urban landscapes and interstellar vehicles. He worked as a "visual futurist" for many Hollywood movies, such as "Star Trek: The Motion Picture," where he designed the V'ger probe; "Tron," where he designed the light cycles and other digital elements; "Aliens," where he designed the Sulaco spaceship and the dropship; "2010," where he designed the Leonov spacecraft and the Discovery modifications; "Timecop," where he designed the time machine and the futuristic cars; "Short Circuit," where he designed the robot Johnny Five; "Mission to Mars," where he designed the Mars habitat and the orbiting station; "Mission: Impossible III," where he designed the Shanghai skyscraper and the Vatican infiltration device; "Elysium," where he designed the orbital habitat and the medical pods; and "Tomorrowland," where he designed the futuristic city and the jetpacks.

Mead was also a prolific designer for Ford Motor Company, U.S. Steel, and Philips Electronics. After establishing himself as a "Futurist" consultant, he visualized technology and products for companies like Sony, Chrysler, Mechanix Illustrated, and Playboy. He also designed solar powered unicycles, show cars, luxury yachts, cruise ships, private jets, and interplanetary spacecraft. He had a unique blend of futurism and believability in his designs, which he called "reality ahead of schedule."
  
Mead was born in St. Paul Minnesota, on July 18th, 1933 but spent only a few years there before moving to what would be the second of many homes throughout the western United States prior to graduating from High School in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 1951. His father was a Baptist minister, who read him pulp magazines, such as Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon, sparking his interest in science fiction. Mead was skilled in drawing at a young age and attended the Art Center School in Los Angeles (now the Art Center College of Design, Pasadena), where he graduated with great distinction in June of 1959.
