If you have a GM Tech 2 scanner and want to use it for SPS programming, you will need the Tis2000 software and a dongle crack to make it work. Tis2000 is the official diagnostic software for GM vehicles from 1997 to 2007. It allows you to perform various diagnostic functions, such as reading and clearing codes, viewing data, and performing bi-directional controls. However, Tis2000 also has a function called SPS (Service Programming System), which allows you to update the firmware of the modules in your vehicle, such as the PCM, BCM, ABS, etc.
 
SPS programming requires an online subscription from GM, which is expensive and not available for everyone. That's why some people have created a dongle crack for Tis2000, which bypasses the authentication process and lets you use SPS without a subscription. However, installing and using Tis2000 with a dongle crack is not a straightforward process. You will need some technical skills and patience to make it work. In this article, we will show you how to install and use FULL GM North America Tis2000 Software DONGLE CRACK on your Windows XP/7/8 computer.
