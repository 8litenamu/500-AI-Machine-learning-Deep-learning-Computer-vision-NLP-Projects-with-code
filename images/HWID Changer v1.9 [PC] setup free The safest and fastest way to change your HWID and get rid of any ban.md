## What are the Benefits and Risks of Changing HWID?
 
Changing HWID can have some benefits and risks, depending on your purpose and situation. Here are some of the pros and cons of changing HWID:
 
### Benefits of Changing HWID

- One of the main benefits of changing HWID is that it can help you bypass anti-cheat systems or access restricted websites that use HWID as a way to track or ban you. For example, if you were banned from an online game for using hacks or cheats, you can change your HWID and play again without being detected[^3^].
- Another benefit of changing HWID is that it can allow you to transfer your Windows license to a new device, if you have a retail license that is not tied to a specific device. For example, if you upgrade your PC with a new motherboard and CPU, which are major hardware changes that will affect your HWID, you can change your HWID back to the original one and activate Windows with the same license[^1^].

### Risks of Changing HWID

- One of the main risks of changing HWID is that it can deactivate your Windows license, if you have an OEM license that is tied to a specific device. For example, if you change your HWID on a PC that came pre-installed with Windows, you will lose your Windows activation and need to purchase a new license[^1^].
- Another risk of changing HWID is that it can cause some compatibility or performance issues with your device or applications. For example, if you change your HWID on a PC that has some drivers or software that rely on your HWID, you might encounter some errors or malfunctions[^4^] [^5^].
