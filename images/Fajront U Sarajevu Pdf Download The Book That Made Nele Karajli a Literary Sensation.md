Nele KarajliÄ was born on 11 December 1962 in Sarajevo, then part of Yugoslavia. His real name is Nenad JankoviÄ, but he adopted the pseudonym Nele KarajliÄ when he started his musical career. He grew up in a middle-class family, with a father who was a lawyer and a mother who was a teacher. He attended the First Gymnasium of Sarajevo, where he met his future bandmates and friends.
 
In 1980, he formed Zabranjeno PuÅ¡enje (No Smoking) with Davor SuÄiÄ (Sejo Sexon), Zoran Degan (DraÅ¾en RiÄl), Mustafa ÄengiÄ (Mujo SnaÅ¾ni), Ognjen GajiÄ (Ogi) and Zenit ÄoziÄ (Fu-Do). The band was part of the New Primitivism movement, which combined rock music with folk elements, humor and social satire. The band's debut album Das ist Walter (1984) was a huge success, selling over 100,000 copies and spawning hits such as Zenica Blues, Anarhija All Over BaÅ¡ÄarÅ¡ija and Nedelja Kad Je OtiÅ¡ao Hase.
 
In 1984, KarajliÄ also joined Top Lista Nadrealista (The Surrealist Top Chart), a comedy sketch show that aired on TV Sarajevo. The show was created by Zabranjeno PuÅ¡enje and their friends from the New Primitivism movement, such as Branko ÄuriÄ (Äuro), Admir GlamoÄak (Glamocak) and Elvis J. KurtoviÄ. The show parodied the political and social reality of Yugoslavia, using absurd humor and surreal situations. The show was very popular and controversial, often provoking censorship and lawsuits.
